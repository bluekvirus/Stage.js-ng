#WebUI Skeleton
Blueprint for single page web/hybrid front-end projects.

##Usage
###1. Create your project:
```
brunch new gh:bluekvirus/skeleton-webui .
```
Ignore the error/warning messages as we didn't put any `bower.json` or `pakcage.json` under the project root.

###2. Initialize it:
```
cd ./libs
bower install

cd ./build
npm install
```
Gulp configure is under `./build` as well.
